## Installation

This plugin modifies the game using [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx), so it is needed to install BepInEx to load this plugin, here are the steps to achieve this:
- Find the installation directory of the game *(Usually in `steamapps/common`, you can find this from the game properties in steam -> local files -> browse...)*
- Download the plugin bundle: [**`QoLWitchNobeta.zip`**](/../../releases/download/latest/QoLWitchNobeta.zip)
- Copy all the files from the archive inside the game directory *(Where there is `LittleWitchNobeta.exe`)*

A correct installation directory content should look like this:
```
.
├── BepInEx
├── dotnet
├── LittleWitchNobeta_Data
├── GameAssembly.dll
├── LittleWitchNobeta.exe
├── UnityCrashHandler64.exe
├── UnityPlayer.dll
├── baselib.dll
├── changelog.txt
├── doorstop_config.ini
└── winhttp.dll
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Concurrent installation with [RandomizedWitchNobeta](https://github.com/Eveldee/RandomizedWitchNobeta/) is not recommended as they share features.

## Game modifications

### ➤ It is possible to fast travel to any unlocked statue at any progression point in the game

This eliminates any worry about going past the "Point of no return" and missing any treasure.

Going back past the point of no return seems to have no ill effects no gameplay.

### ➤ Statues are auto-unlocked for fast travel when passing by them

This does provide a small gameplay advantage in that you can unlock a statue and then backtrack without respawning monsters.

### ➤ Hotkeys may be used to swap between outfits without unlocking

The hotkeys for switching outfits are:

- **Page Up** - Next outfit
- **Page Down** - Previous outfit
- **Home** - Toggle Hat visibility
- **End** - Toggle Bag visibility

(Hotkeys can not be changed without editing the code.)

## Building

To build as a working BepInEx plugin, two steps are required:
- Clone this repository and make sure .Net 6.0 SDK is installed
- Get the required interop files generated by BepInEx and include it in the `lib/interop` directory

The easiest way to generate the needed interop files is to install the plugin as explained in [**installation**](#installation). The generated interop files can be found in the root game folder under `BepInEx/interop`.

Once those two steps are done, the plugin can be built using either the dotnet CLI or your preferred IDE. The output will be a `.dll` file that needs to be placed in the directory `BepInEx/Plugin/QoLWitchNobeta`.
